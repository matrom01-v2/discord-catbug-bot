> The following is a project in an attempt to learn JS and the Discord APIs. Catbug is meant specifically for my personal discord, but feel free to check out the code 
and see how I handled certain commands and interacted with databases!

> Obviously, there are a few sensetive files I did not include for safety, and some files that pertain only to my server. For example, the rule data only applies to my server, but can work for any set of rules in JSON objects. 

> Catbug's functions so far: 
### Hello
Catbug says hello

### Help
Catbug displays a list of usable commands
 
### Level
Catbug keeps track of user messages, and grants XP on a cooldown. Use the command to see a user's rank and friendship level with Catbug!
  
### Profile
Catbug can create and edit a profile for a user! So far the profiles contain name, pronouns, and a biography to keep track of people in the server. Use /friend to see a user's profile! The profile and Level systems utilize MongoDB and interact accordingly.
   
### Kick and Ban
Catbug can kick and ban users, but is only usable for designated roles and user's marked as "devsOnly"
